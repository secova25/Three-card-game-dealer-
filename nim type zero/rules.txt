The game starts with each player having four cards in their hand not revealed to their opponents.
A hand's "strength" is a factor of how well a player can utilize their hand to avoid losing the game.
For example, a hand of [1, 1, 1, 2] is an alright hand, a hand of [0, 0, 1, 2] is a good hand, and a
hand of [1, 2, 3, 3] is a bad hand. At a player's turn, they must play a card from their hand by declaring 
its number and placing it down on the table. The card's value is added to the total value.
If the total value exceeds 9, the player loses their bet. The game continues in rounds until a player can no longer bet,
or until a certain round number has been reached.
